1) Research paper focuses on  studying large amounts of data, particularly in the medical literature database SemMedDB.
2) Challenges arise from the non-intutive nature of navigating interconnected data points.
3) The paper addresses this issue by selecting key tablets(entity, predicte, sentence) from SemMedDB.
4) Selected tables are uploaded into Neo4j graphing software for visulaization of data relationships.
5) Goal is to enhance accessibility and understanding of the semMedDB, making it more user-friendly for research.
6) Sample Queries demonstrate how information can be extracted and displayed visually.
7) Aim is to improve the current research experience and open avenues for extensive future research and analysis oppurtunities.
